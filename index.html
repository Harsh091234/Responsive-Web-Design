            <img src="Assets/Images/Jupiter.jfif" alt="">
            <p>Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest in our solar system and primarily composed of
                hydrogen and helium. Known as a gas giant, it boasts vibrant cloud bands and iconic storms, including
                the centuries-old Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 92 confirmed moons, including the four large Galilean
                moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. It has a massive magnetic field, the strongest among all
                planets, and faint rings made of dust. Jupiter’s rapid rotation causes it to bulge at the equator.
                Located beyond the asteroid belt, it plays a crucial role in shaping the solar system’s structure and
                dynamics.</p>

            <p>
                Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a terrestrial planet known for its reddish appearance due to
                iron oxide on its surface. Smaller and colder than Earth, it has a thin carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere,
                polar ice caps, and dusty plains. Mars hosts the solar system’s tallest volcano, Olympus Mons, and the
                deepest canyon, Valles Marineris. With evidence of ancient rivers and lakes, Mars is a key target in the
                search for past life. Its two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, are thought to be captured asteroids.
                Robotic missions continue to study Mars, paving the way for potential human exploration.

            <img src="Assets/Images/earth.jfif" alt="">
            <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse
                environment, with continents, vast oceans, and an atmosphere rich in oxygen and nitrogen. Earth’s
                surface is shaped by plate tectonics, forming mountains, valleys, and volcanoes. Its climate and weather
                systems sustain a wide variety of ecosystems, from forests to deserts. The planet’s unique water cycle
                supports life, with liquid water covering about 71% of its surface. Earth orbits the Sun in the
                habitable zone and has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences tides and stabilizes its axial
                tilt.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <img src="Assets/Images/neptune.jfif" alt="">
            <p>Neptune, the eighth planet from the Sun, is an ice giant known for its vivid blue color caused by methane
                in its atmosphere. It has the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching over 2,100 km/h, and hosts
                massive storms like the Great Dark Spot. Neptune has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, including
                Triton, which orbits retrograde and may be a captured Kuiper Belt object. Composed of hydrogen, helium,
                water, ammonia, and methane, its interior remains mysterious. Discovered in 1846, Neptune is the most
                distant planet, completing one orbit around the Sun roughly every 165 Earth years.</p>

            <img src="Assets/Images/saturn.jfif" alt="">

            <p>Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is a massive gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.
                It’s best known for its iconic ring system, made of ice and rock particles, stretching wide yet thin.
                Saturn has over 140 moons and moonlets, with Titan, the largest, having a dense atmosphere and liquid
                hydrocarbon lakes. The planet’s low density means it could float in water if a body large enough
                existed. Saturn’s rapid rotation creates a flattened shape at its poles. Its unique features and moons
                make it a fascinating target for exploration, unveiling secrets of planetary science and dynamics.</p>
